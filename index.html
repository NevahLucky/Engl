				<p>Welcome to my website dedicated to raising awareness about the dangers of overwork in the game
					development industry. The mission is to highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life
					balance and to provide resources and support for game developers who are struggling with the
					pressures of their profession.</p>

				<h2>What is Karoshi?</h2>
				<p>Karoshi is a Japanese term that translates to "death from overwork." It refers to the phenomenon
					where individuals suffer fatal health conditions, such as heart attacks or strokes, due to excessive
					work hours and stress.</p>
				<div class="highlighted-story">
					<h4><u>December 25, 2015</u></h4>
					<p>24-year-old Matsuri Takahashi died by suicide, jumping from her company dormitory.
						Takahashi was an
						employee of Japan’s largest advertising agency, Dentsu Inc., notorious for its rigorous
						working
						environment.</p>
					<p>Prior to her death, Takahashi had posted several disturbing messages to her Twitter account,
						expressing her
						helplessness. “It’s 4 a.m. My body’s trembling. I’m going to die. I’m so tired” and “I’m
						physically
						and emotionally
						shattered” are just two of the numerous cries for help Takahashi posted to social media.</p>

					<p>An investigation by Tokyo’s Labour Standard’s Bureau found that Takahashi consistently worked
						more than 100 hours of overtime in a single month, as instructed by her superiors. Takahashi’s
						story
						created
						nationwide outrage, leading to the
						approval of the 2018 Workstyle Reform Act, outlawing employees from working more than 45
						hours of
						overtime in a single
						month.</p>
				</div>
				<p>While the term originated in Japan, the concept of overwork-related deaths is not limited to a
					single country or industry. Game developers, in particular, are at high risk of experiencing
					health issues due to the demanding nature of their work.</p>
				<h4>Statistics:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>World Health Organization (WHO) and International Labour Organization (ILO) joint unveiled that
						in 2021,
						approximately
						750,000 deaths due to Karoshi syndrome globally.</li>
					<li>Survey results by Moberly and Stobo on burnout in the game development industry found that:
						Developers with 4-6 years of experience, particularly those in senior roles, are most likely to
						report burnout.
						Interestingly, burnout does not consistently increase with experience or seniority. Lead
						developers and those with over
						six years in the industry are slightly less likely to report burnout, while game directors
						report very low levels (13%).</li>
					<li>Studies have shown a strong correlation between excessive work hours and a decline in
						both
						mental and physical health. In the same survey issued by Moberly and Stobo, about 27 percent
						bounced back between zero and six months, and another 20 percent pulled it off between six
						months to a
						year.

						But almost 30 percent said it took them one to three years to recover. About 11 percent needed
						three to five years. And
						just over 13 percent said they needed five or more years to come back from the brink.</li>

				<h2>Why Game Developers Are at Risk</h2>
				<div class="image-text-overlay">

					<div class="overlay-text">
						<h3>Crunch Culture</h3>
						<p>Crunch culture refers to the intense periods of work that game developers often endure to
							meet project deadlines. This culture is prevalent in the industry and is characterized by
							long hours, high stress, and little to no time off.</p>
						<p>High-profile cases, such as those reported in major studios, have brought attention to the
							detrimental effects of crunch culture on developers' health and well-being.</p>
						<h3>Unhealthy Work Habits</h3>
						<p>Game developers often work long hours, have irregular sleep patterns, and maintain poor
							diets. <b>Hidetaka Miyazaki</b>, famed developer of Elden Ring, left the office only
							sporadically, to shower for months before his prized game's release. These unhealthy work
							habits contribute to physical and mental health issues, making
							developers more susceptible to burnout and other stress-related conditions.</p>
						<h3>Perfectionism and Passion</h3>
						<p>While passion for game development can drive creativity and innovation, it can also lead to
							unsustainable work practices. Developers may push themselves to the limit in pursuit of
							perfection, neglecting their health and personal lives in the process.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Salazar said. "There were [college graduates] that were learning to program that had never
						programmed before and things like that.
						Killing themselves to do it. Staying after hours to learn more about their new job they hadn't
						studied at school."

						Understanding all of this, the question ceases to be whether crunch exists in Japanese game
						development. Video games are
						just one part of a larger tech employment culture that often demands long hours. What we call
						development crunch in the
						West remains relatively normalized in Japan across lots of different industries, especially
						white-collar jobs that take
						part in an office environment.</p>

				<h2>The Consequences of Overwork</h2>
				<div class="image-text-overlay">
					<img src="img/womanStressed.jpg" alt="woman sitting in front of computer">
					<div class="overlay-text">
						<h3>Physical Health</h3>
						<p>Overwork can lead to a range of stress-related illnesses, including heart disease,
							hypertension,
							and
							fatigue-related accidents. The physical toll of long hours and high stress can have serious,
							and
							sometimes fatal, consequences.</p>
						<h3>Mental Health</h3>
						<p>Burnout, depression, and anxiety are common among overworked game developers. The constant
							pressure
							to meet deadlines and the lack of work-life balance can lead to a decline in mental health,
							affecting both personal and professional life.</p>
						<h3>Personal Life</h3>
						<p>Overwork can strain relationships and lead to social isolation. Developers may find
							themselves
							sacrificing time with family and friends, leading to a sense of loneliness and disconnection
							from
							their personal lives. The line between work and life blurs so heavily that they can't see a
							difference. </p>
						<p>In Japan, the workplace is considered a second home as most employees stick
							around with their initial company for life. The pressure to keep working is so overbearing
							for most that overtime remains the norm, not the outlier.</p>

				<h2>Counterpoints and Reframing Success</h2>
				<h3>Misconception: Success demands 24/7 dedication.</h3>
				<p>There is a common misconception that success in the game development industry requires constant
					dedication and long hours. However, this belief is not only harmful but also counterproductive.</p>
				<h3>Reframe:</h3>
				<p>A healthy, rested mind is more creative and productive. By prioritizing health and well-being,
					developers can achieve better results and maintain their passion for their work.</p>
					<p>Take for example Gary Keller, a man whose net worth is over $200 million. The burnout from overworking himself led to the rise of a new philosophy and newfound success. In his book, The One Thing, Keller explains that life is like juggling five balls. The difference between them, four are glass and one is rubber. The rubber ball is work, and even if you drop it, you can always pickup right where you left. The same cannot be said for your relationships with your health, family and friends. Don't limit your experiences to one corner of our marvelous world.</p>
				<p>Teams and workplaces thrive with sustainable practices. Encouraging a healthy work-life balance can
					lead to more innovative and successful projects, benefiting both developers and the industry as a
					whole.</p>
